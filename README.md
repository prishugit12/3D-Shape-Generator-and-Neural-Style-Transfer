# 3D-Shape-Generator
This project explores neural implicit representations for real-time 360° surface rotation and continuous 3D geometry learning. I implemented a coordinate-based MLP that learns signed distance functions (SDFs) to represent  complex 3D manifolds as continuous fields rather than discrete meshes or voxels.

# Neural-Style-Transfer
A clean implementation of the classic Gatys et al. (CVPR 2016) neural style transfer approach, with an interactive interface for real-time experimentation. This project separates content from style by matching feature statistics between layers of a pre-trained VGG19 network.
