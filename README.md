# 3D-Shape-Generator
This project explores neural implicit representations for real-time 360° surface rotation and continuous 3D geometry learning. I implemented a coordinate-based MLP that learns signed distance functions (SDFs) to represent  complex 3D manifolds as continuous fields rather than discrete meshes or voxels.
